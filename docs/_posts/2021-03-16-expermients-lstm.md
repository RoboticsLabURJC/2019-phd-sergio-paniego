New experiments this week.

Experiments:
* [Results for different data augmentation strategies](#experiment-1)
* [Results for different data augmentation strategies only in Montmel贸](#experiment-2)

# 1. Results for different data augmentation strategies

In the experiment, different data augmentation strategies are explored only using Deepest LSTM Pilotnet architecture. This experiment 
started in the last section of last week's blog and here are the results of all the different strategies. 
These experiments are:

* Remove moderate data from the dataset. Data sequences with a majority of low turn values are removed.
* Add extreme sequences twice to the dataset. 
* Add extreme sequences twice and remove moderate sequences. 
* Add patched images to the dataset. The image red line is removed and added to the dataset.
* Add gaussian noise to the dataset. 

In this case, the results show that they still can't complete the Montmel贸 circuit but most of then can complete the rest of the scenarios.

# 2. Results for different data augmentation strategies only in Montmel贸

More experiments for the same nets in Montmel贸. In this case, we can see that the network trained with gaussian noise data augmentation is the 
best one even completing the circuit once. It is the only regression based network that has completed the circuit so far. It's also important
to consider that the experiments start on a random position and rotation in the circuit.
