Research about LSTMs is conducted during this week. Additionally, the architecture figure in the paper is updated
 and Behavior Studio is installed.
 
## LSTMs research

First of all, I spent some time watching this [Youtube talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S27pHKBEp30) about Transformers. 
Lately, Transformers development has experimented a boosts and they are suppose to replace LSTMs in the long run, at least in 
natural language processing.
