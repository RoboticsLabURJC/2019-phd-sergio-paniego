## Dataset distribution with and without extreme cases

In the following images, we can see the different dataset distributions with and without extreme cases.
Without extreme cases, the distribution of cases for the W variable (2 image on each pair) looks quite unbalanced, with the 
majority of cases in the middle of the plot.
